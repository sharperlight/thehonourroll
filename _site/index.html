            <h2 id="natsume-soseki">Natsume Soseki</h2>

<p>An insightful and somber quote from Japanese poet and novelist, Natsume Soseki (1867-1916):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You see, loneliness is the price we have to pay for being born in this modern age, so full of freedom, independence, and our own egoistical selves.</p>

            <h2 id="apples-deep-fusion-technology">Apple’s Deep Fusion Technology</h2>

<p>While Apple usually explains complicated technologies in a simple to understand manner – arguably the best in the industry – honestly, the 10 September event was confusing, light on details, and quite underwhelming. Exciting technologies such as the U1 chip, Deep Fusion, and SoC details [for Apple Watch Series 5] barely got any mention. There was way too much time dedicated to game demos, advertising videos, and speaker transitions. Not to mention a very head-tilting naming scheme for the new lineup of iPhones. <em>iPhone 11 Pro Max</em>… really?</p>

<p>Why not simply name the lineup: <em>iPhone 11</em> and <em>iPhone 11 Pro</em>, and then differentiate the two Pro iPhones by size? This would at least bring some consistency between <em>iPhone Pro</em>, <em>MacBook Pro</em>, and <em>iPad Pro</em>. Heck, I’ve been hoping Apple would drop model numbers entirely and just refer to iPhones by their launch year. I think most people would agree that <em>iPhone Pro</em> (2019, 6.5-inch) is a lot better than <em>iPhone 11 Pro Max</em>. But anyway, my issues with Apple’s confusing naming scheme should be saved for another time.</p>

<p>During this week’s keynote, Phil Schiller took stage to explain some of the secrets behind the iPhone 11’s camera technology. Of particular note and interest was Deep Fusion. Schiller’s explanation left a lot to be desired – and a lot to the imagination. Frustratingly, a lot of tech journalists have little idea what Deep Fusion is and have struggled to explain what the technology does. For example, this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/apple-iphone-deep-fusion/">engadget article</a> says that Deep Fusion is Apple’s technology to tackle Google’s Night Sight. This is completely false. Apple will be employing Night Mode to do so.</p>

<p>My understanding of Deep Fusion is that it is a machine learning (ML) based technology, powered by the A13 Bionic’s Neural Engine to replace or sidestep the camera’s image signalling processor (ISP) image capturing pipeline. My guess is that Deep Fusion only replaces the ISP’s duties for still photos, and that the ISP does most of the heavy lifting for other photo modes and video. When taking a photo, the A13 Bionic and iPhone’s camera lenses will basically take nine images: four short burst images taken before the user hits the photo button, four short burst images once the user hits the photo button, and a single long exposure image.</p>

<p>The A13 Bionic’s Neural Engine will then analyse all nine images, applying various algorithms at the pixel and sub-pixel level to blend the images and combine them into a final image. The closest comparison I can think would be advanced anti-aliasing filtering techniques from the likes of AMD and Nvidia when it comes to 3D rendering pipelines. The key point is that the A13 Bionic determines how the final image is put together, pixel by pixel, rather than the camera ISP bluntly and broadly fusing multiple captured images. The technology is remarkable, and I’m just so surprised that Apple didn’t take more time to explain it further.</p>

<p>I’m sure someone from the likes of Anandtech or Arstechnica will explore Deep Fusion soon.</p>

<p>Another day, another Facebook user data and privacy breach. From the techcrunch article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The exposed server contained more than 419 million records over several databases on users across geographies, including 133 million records on U.S.-based Facebook users, 18 million records of users in the U.K., and another with more than 50 million records on users in Vietnam.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But because the server wasn’t protected with a password, anyone could find and access the database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is getting absolutely ridiculous. You would have to be insane to trust Facebook with any of your private data, let alone a hotdog stand.</p>

<p>Also, just to remind you all: Facebook owns Instagram and Whatsapp too. Whatever data you have on those platforms isn’t safe either.</p>

<p>Perth, and the suburbs of Joondalup and Clarkson, seem so far away now…</p>

<p>I also have little idea where I’ll end up after the UK. When I’m asked where I plan on being after the UK I usually answer:

            <h2 id="the-fate-of-hong-kong">The Fate of Hong Kong</h2>

<p>As I await to board a flight to Hong Kong, I wonder how the situation escalated so acutely in such a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Hong Kong was perhaps fated to this collision course ever since the days of empire, after it was taken by the British. After that, the British faced a situation of “damned if you, damned if you don’t” when it came to deciding Hong Kong’s sovereignty.</p>

<p>With 20/20 hindsight it’s easy to criticise the British decision to annex Hong Kong to the PRC. At the time, however, it seemed like the sensible thing to do. The PRC had adopted its “two systems one country” rule under the Deng Xiaoping, and China was an up and coming superpower. There was also hope and optimism that China would soften its stance towards its citizens, and expand their civil rights.</p>

<p>But, then again, one could’ve lashed out against the British decision citing Tiananmen Square as a prime example of China saying one thing but doing another.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, the people of Hong Kong, and the international community, must come to accept the 1997 annexation. But, China should be held responsible for overreaching and violating its “two system one country” promise. There is very little doubt that the controversial extradition bill was the spark that blew the TNT on this entire situation. That was clearly wrong, and could only come across as disingenuous.</p>

<p>Hopefully, calm heads will prevail.</p>

<p>In news that is surprising to nobody, Bloomberg reports that Facebook has been hiring external contractors to listen to and transcribe private conversations on its popular Messenger app. Facebook defends its actions by saying that companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google do the same thing. Unfortunately for Facebook and Zuckerberg, things are not that simple.</p>

<p>A recent report from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings">The Guardian</a> revealed that Apple listened to a small sample of audio recordings; but only of customers interacting with Siri. Google too was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17594802/google-home-how-to-delete-conversations-recorded">caught red handed</a> recording Google Home and “OK Google!” interactions, and at a much larger scale than what Apple did with Siri. Amazon was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/7/17092334/amazon-alexa-devices-strange-laughter">worst offender</a>, as it was revealed that its Echo speakers consistently listened to everything users said.</p>

<p>But, there is still a big difference between Facebook, and Amazon, Apple, and Google. The latter used voice recordings of customers interacting with their AI voice assistants, while Facebook actually listens to your private conversations with other people. It’s actually a pretty stark difference.</p>

<p>This is just another reason, on an ever growing list, to take digital privacy seriously.</p>

<p>It brings me great pleasure to belatedly announce to my dear friends and family, that I have been officially accepted as a graduate student into the University of Oxford. I will begin my studies at Oxford this September, with a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in economics.</p>

<p>To say that this has been a long time coming would be an understatement. This announcement marks the achievement of a dream and goal that began over six years ago.</p>

<p>Further, and most importantly, being accepted into Oxford is not due to the efforts of me alone. I cannot stress this enough. I was well and truly supported, motivated, inspired, mentored, and challenged to get this far. The list of people who I wish to extend my most sincere thanks and appreciation is long. Chances are, if you’re reading this, you are one of the people I wish to thank.</p>

<p>To my amazing friends and family I grew up with, laughed with, worked with, and studied with in Perth, Osaka, Canberra, and Tokyo: <strong>Thank you!</strong> Thank you so much.</p>

<p>More recently, I wish to express my most sincere gratitude to Professor Ippei Fujiwara. One of the most dedicated, passionate, sharpest and brightest individuals I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. I hope to continue his legacy and passion for research, teaching, and desire for knowledge. I’ve got big shoes to fill, but I approach the challenge with enthusiasm and boundless optimism.</p>

<p>But, it is also imperative to keep in mind that this is just another step – another journey – in the adventure of life. I look forward to discovering, learning, and achieving even bigger and better things – with all your support. I am absolutely certain that there will be good times and bad times. Times where I will fall, fail, and make mistakes. I ask that you continue to tolerate, teach, and help me with whatever comes next, together.</p>

<p>In a change of pace, rather than talking about Apple, let’s talk about Intel (oh boy…). As many who have been following PC hardware recently would know, Intel has been struggling. They’ve been stuck on their 14nm process for years, their Skylake architecture is looking very long in the tooth, their consumer lineup is a horrible mess, AMD has become a very real threat in enterprise and server markets, and x86’s future remains as uncertain as ever.</p>

<p>I, however, believe that Intel will make a strong turnaround next year. This will be spearheaded by <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/raja-m-koduri/#gs.ta1ti3">Raja Koduri</a> leading Intel’s GPU technology efforts, and semiconductor architect superstar <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13048/an-anandtech-exclusive-the-jim-keller-interview">Jim Keller</a> joining the fray too. I anticipate big and significant announcements from Koduri and Keller, who have pulled off miracle after miracle everywhere they’ve been.</p>

<p>But, more immediate than whatever projects Koduri and Keller are working on, is the upcoming introduction and launch of Intel’s new CPU microarchitecture. At long last, Skylake has a successor – one that will also come out on Intel’s perhaps still janky 10nm process. Say hello to Sunny Cove.</p>

<p><img src="https://hirothreading.github.io/thehonourroll//assets/images/intelsunnycove.jpg" alt="Intel's Sunny Cove microarchitecture" height="200px" width="350px" /></p>

<p>Anandtech has prepared a fantastic <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/14514/examining-intels-ice-lake-microarchitecture-and-sunny-cove">deep dive</a> on Sunny Cove. If you have a free afternoon, I definitely recommend taking a good read. According to this Anandtech report, Intel has rejigged their CPU architecture in dramatic fashion – perhaps as big of a change since the Nehalem to Sandy Bridge transition!</p>

<p>If Intel can deliver on all their promises, then we’re looking at some significant performance, power efficiency, and platform/package efficiency gains. Average instruction per-clock gains are predicted to be roughly 18% over Skylake, on-die integration of Thunderbolt 3 (and hence a doubling of PCIe lanes from the CPU die), a revamped cache and memory controller system, and a large increase in GPU resources all point toward a very impressive new architecture.</p>

<p>That is, of course, if Intel can deliver on these promises…</p>

<p>The sheer scale and strength of this company never ceases to amaze me. Here are the headline figures: $53.8 billion in revenue, $10 billion in net profit, and 37.6% gross margin just for this quarter alone. This is roughly a one per cent increase over the previous year-ago quarter.</p>

<p>These figures are being driven on the back of Mac revenue increasing 11% YoY, iPad revenue up 8% YoY, Services up 13% YoY, and <strong>Wearables up 68% YoY</strong>. I can only see these figures increasing over the coming year, as Apple continues to fill out these categories with some interesting products such as the new Mac Pro and MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>Add this to the list of things I thought would happen. This is another natural progression of Apple’s – and perhaps more specifically, Tim Cook’s – approach to its platforms and devices.</p>

<p>Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve worked with Intel for many years and know this team shares Apple’s passion for designing technologies that deliver the world’s best experiences for our users. Apple is excited to have so many excellent engineers join our growing cellular technologies group, and know they’ll thrive in Apple’s creative and dynamic environment. They, together with our significant acquisition of innovative IP, will help expedite our development on future products and allow Apple to further differentiate moving forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With full control over the CPU, GPU, and now, cellular modem, this will allow Apple to further increase their already dominant lead in hardware performance and efficiency on their devices.</p>

<p>There’s been a lot of talk in the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/14676/apple-to-buy-bulk-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business">tech media</a> about how this Intel deal will affect Apple’s 2020 (and beyond) iPhones – particularly iPhone’s 5G capabilities.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I think a lot of pundits are missing another key opportunity that this buyout presents Apple: the opportunity to miniaturise cellular modems for ultraportable devices and wearables.</p>

<p>While iPhone will be the short term benefactor of this deal, I think the bigger winners amongst Apple’s devices and platforms will be the Apple Watch, AirPods, and perhaps other future yet-to-be-announced wearable devices. The Mac and iPad will also benefit from Apple’s in-house modems, but to lesser extent as they’re nowhere near as thermally or physically limited as the iPhone and Apple Watch.</p>

<p>I also believe that this won’t be the last we hear of Apple’s desire to control more of the components in its devices. For example, we know that Apple is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/apple-is-said-to-develop-displays-to-replace-samsung-screens">developing MicroLED technology</a>, with potentially significant benefits across all of its hardware platforms. Phil Schiller has also talked about how important camera technology is to iPhone, and how he views iPhone as the modern-day replacement to the point-and-shoot camera. So we may see Apple make further aggressive moves in the areas of camera technology.</p>

<p>In any case, this Apple-Intel deal will be a boon to Apple – and, more importantly, to Apple’s customers.</p>

<p>Last month I was invited to a public screening of the BBC produced documentary, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3z44Njyr5wzm3wbVMGZ7tFr/shiori-ito-japan-s-attitudes-to-allegations-of-sexual-violence-are-locked-in-the-past?fbclid=IwAR0_v4FXCMuaBYGNg_t5KbYoBUisaqSjWbFX7SmpyOonLtqgfEhU6x0fT54">Japan’s Secret Shame</a>. The screening was organised by <a href="https://telljp.com/?fbclid=IwAR1rAFC4EUCMwhf92pCQ2Qsp7AcwL915fXOhw6SAUXvAuLTpEQ0tE0YxL1g">tell Japan</a>, an organisation dedicated to counselling and raising awareness around mental health issues in Japan. They’re a fantastic organisation, and I recommend everyone to check them out.</p>

<p>Japan’s Secret Shame tells the story of Shiori Ito, a former journalism student who was studying in New York with ambitions to return to Japan to start her career. While in New York she met Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a senior journalist from broadcaster TBS Japan. Mr Yamaguchi made an informal promise to Ms Ito that he would help with her career once her studies were complete in New York, and after she returned back to Tokyo. Ms Ito, like any enthusiastic young person willing to make their mark on the world, took Mr Yamaguchi up on his offer.</p>

<p>Ms Ito returned to Tokyo once her studies were finished, and she met Mr Yamaguchi in person over dinner. Mr Yamaguchi had other plans for their encounter however.</p>

<p>Ms Ito alleges that Mr Yamaguchi drugged and raped her.</p>

<p>Whether or not you believe Ms Ito’s account of events is one thing — the documentary isn’t concerned about that. What the documentary highlights is Japan’s ridiculously archaic and barbaric legal system, completely inept and unable to support victims of sexual violence — whether it be women, men, or — tragically — children.</p>

<p>Further, the documentary shines a spotlight on the disgusting and idiotic views of politicians such as <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/09/05/national/lgbt-politicians-condemn-diet-members-slur-lgbt-couples-ask-abe/#.XTg4ri1L3UI">Mio Sugita</a> and other media shock jocks, who have done nothing but condemn Ms Ito and the thousands of other Japanese women each year who are brave enough to speak out against rape and sexual violence.</p>

<p>I strongly urge you all, if you have a spare hour, to watch Japan’s Secret Shame. It’s not an easy watch, but it is extremely informative and of critical importance.</p>

<p>I viewed it at a public screening, and witnessed the impact it had on the audience. As I turned to the rest of audience after the screening, I noticed that dozens of women were left with hands over their mouths and with tears in their eyes. No doubt this issue — this injustice — hit close to home for many.</p>

<p>An excellent introduction to semiconductors, CMOS design, and microprocessor architectures by Anandtech.</p>

<p>Fun fact – and some of my friends know this – after entering university, I was so close to changing my major to electrical engineering. Having tinkered with PCs throughout high school, and being utterly obsessed with how companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia built and designed chip architectures such as NetBurst, Hammer, Conroe, R500, G80, R600, RV770, and so on. I wanted to become a semiconductor/chip architect myself!</p>

<p>This was around the time Apple was making its way into designing its own chips too. I recall there being news about how it was custom designing its own A4 System-on-Chip (SoC). The A4 was an amazing SoC, powering the high performance graphics of the iPhone 4’s Retina display. Apple continued hitting home runs with its custom chip adventures with the A5, A5X, A6, and all the way to today’s industry leading A12X Bionic SoC inside its iPad Pro.</p>

<p>This stuff fascinates me to this day. Intel’s venerable Skylake architecure (now very long in the tooth), AMD’s Zen 2 and Navi architectures, IBM’s POWER8, and Apple’s SoCs and platform controllers – all of it. I spend way too much reading it how these amazing pieces of technology are designed and built.</p>

<p>Back when I was an undergrad I decided to give up my dreams on becoming an electrical engineer and chip architect. I was told that I would need to study for at least a decade (B.Eng + M.Sc + PhD) to build up expertise in the area. Even then, I would have to go over the US, Japan, or Taiwan to find a job, and then I would have to compete against graduates from institutions such as CalTech, MIT, and Stanford. I decided that it was too long of a commitment.</p>

<p>I would, ironically, end up studying economics for over a decade!</p>

<p>Another gem I found on my Facebook page. My friend <a href="https://bingethinkingpodcast.com/host">Caspar Roxburgh</a> hosts the Binge Thinking podcast:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Binge Thinking’ is a conversation podcast for young intellectuals, activists or just interesting people. Guests share their thoughts on who they are, what they do, and how the modern world looks from their perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The show reveals millennial insights into industries, events, or debates. Listen to smart, funny, eccentric and sometimes outrageous guests you can relate to. If you will live through the next 50 years, hear about those that will be there too. We binge news and current affairs, working life, identity politics, political politics, personal philosophies, relationships and everything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was lucky enough to be invited onto the podcast for its 26th episode back in February 2018. It was a huge blast, and hopefully I can make a return to Caspar’s show again.</p>

            <h2 id="the-prophet-by-kahlil-gibran">“The Prophet” by Kahlil Gibran</h2>

<p>A beautiful quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.<br />
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears. And how else can it be?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The deeper the sorrow that carved into your being, the more joy you can contain. Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?  And is not the lute that soothes your spirit the very wood that was hollowed with knives?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and other say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.”<br />
But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.<br />
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.</p>

            <h2 id="james-c-scott-two-cheers-for-anarchism"><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9816.html">James C. Scott “Two Cheers for Anarchism”</a></h2>

<p>Probably the most critical text from Scott’s fantastic book. Apologies for the long read, but it is well worth it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Public school was invented more or less at the same time as the large factory under a single roof, and the two institutions bear a strong family resemblance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The school was, in a sense, a factory for the basic training of the minimal skills of numeracy and literacy necessary for an industrialising society.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Universal public education is, of course, designed to do far more than merely turn out the labour force required by industry. It is as much a political as an economic institution. It is designed to produce a patriotic citizen whose loyalty to the nation will trump regional and local identities of language, ethnicity and religion. The universal citizenship of revolutionary France had its counterpart in universal conscription. Manufacturing such patriotic citizens through the school system was accomplished less through the manifest curriculum than through its language of instruction, its standardisation and its implicit lessons in regimentation, authority and order.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The modern primary and secondary school system has been much altered by changing theories of pedagogy and, most especially, by affluence and the “youth culture” itself. But there is no mistaking its origins in the factory, if not the prison. Compulsory universal education, however democratising in one sense, has also meant that, with few exceptions, the students have to be there. The fact that attendance is not a choice, not an autonomous act, means that it starts out fundamentally on the wrong foot as a compulsory institution, with all the alienation that this duress implies, especially as children grow older.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great tragedy of the public school system, however, is that it is by and large, a one product factory. This tendency has only been exacerbated by the push in recent decades for standardisation, measurement, testing and accountability. The resulting incentives for students, teachers, principals and whole school districts have had the effect of bending all efforts toward fashioning a standard product that satisfies the criteria the auditors have established.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is this product? It is a certain form of analytical intelligence, narrowly conceived, which can, it is assumed, be measured by tests. We know, of course, that there are many, many skills that valuable and important for a successful society that are not even remotely related to analytical intelligence, among them, artistic talent, imaginative intelligence, mechanical intelligence, musical and dance skills, creative intelligence, emotional intelligence, social skills and ethical intelligence. Some of these aptitudes find a place in extracurricular activities, especially in sports, but not in the measured and graded activities on which so much now depends for students, teachers and schools.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This monochromatic flattening of education is brought to a kind of apotheosis in educational systems like those in France, Japan, China and Korea, where the exercise culminates in a single examination on which one’s future mobility and life’s chances substantially depend. Here the scramble to get into the best-regarded schools, to find extra-hours tutoring, and to attend special exam-preparation cram courses reaches a fever pitch.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How ironic it is that I, who write this, and virtually anyone who reads it, are the beneficiaries, the victors, of this rat race.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those of us who “won” this race are the lifetime beneficiaries of opportunities and privileges that would not likely otherwise have come our way. We are also are likely to carry a lifetime sense of entitlement, superiority, accomplishment and self esteem that comes from this victory. Let us bracket, for the moment, the question of whether this dividend is justified and what it actually means in terms of our value to ourselves and others, and merely note that it represents a fund of social capital that adjusts the odds of financial and status mobility radically in our favour. This is a lifetime privilege extended to perhaps one-fifth at most of those the system turns out.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And what of the rest? What of the, say, 80 percent who in effect lose the race? They carry less social capital; the odds are adjusted against them. Perhaps as important is the fact that they are likely to carry a lifelong sense of having been defeated, of being less valued, of thinking they are inferior and slow witted. This system effect further adjusts the odds against them. And yet, have we any rational reason to credit the judgements of a system that values such a narrow bandwidth of human talents and measures achievement within this band by the ability to sit successfully for an exam?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those who do poorly on tests of analytical intelligence may be incredibly talented at one or more of the many forms of intelligence that are neither taught nor valued by the school system. What sort of a system is it that wastes these talents, that sends four-fifths of its students away with a permanent stigma in the eyes of society’s gatekeepers, and perhaps in their own eyes as well? Are the dubious benefits of the privileges and opportunities accorded a presumed “analytical intelligence elite” by this pedagogical tunnel vision worth so much social damage and waste?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Food for thought.</p>

            <h2 id="apple-adjusts-entry-level-macbook-configurations">Apple Adjusts Entry-Level MacBook Configurations</h2>

<p>Apple has quietly adjusted its mid-2019 lineup for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro</a>:</p>

<p>The 12-inch MacBook with Retina display is no longer for sale. This shouldn’t be to a surprise to anyone. The 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro does a much better job of being an ultraportable, ultrafast device at a similar price point. Realistically speaking, the 12-inch MacBook was doomed as soon as Intel abandoned its plans to further develop competitive sub 5w and 3w mobile processors.</p>

<p>The 13-inch MacBook Air is now the entry-level MacBook, available from just US$999 (with student discount). This should’ve happened from launch day, but I suppose it’s better late than never. Its Retina display now comes with True Tone technology too.</p>

<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro with two Thunderbolt 3 ports and <strong>no</strong> Touch Bar – dubbed the MacBook Escape by Apple fans – is no longer available. Again, this should’ve happened with the launch of 2018 MacBook Air.</p>

<p>The new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and two Thunderbolt 3 ports is now available from US$1,299. This means that <strong>every</strong> MacBook Pro now comes with Touch ID and the Touch Bar. Hallelujah, we finally have some consistency across the MacBook Pro lineup!</p>

<p>A lot of these changes should’ve happened a long time ago, but perhaps were delayed or deferred until Apple could hit sufficient manufacturing yields and margins.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
Unfortunately, the entire MacBook lineup still features Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks">much maligned butterfly keyboards</a>, so we’ll have to wait a little while longer to get new keyboards. I expect this to happen either the end of this year, or early next year when Apple moves to a new chassis across its MacBook lineups.</p>

<p>But, we should focus on the positives of today’s shuffling: the MacBook lineup finally makes some damn sense. Students and people who want portable macOS should aim for the MacBook Air, working professionals take the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and content creators and developers can claim the 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Following updates to the iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro, 2019 is shaping up to be a great year for the Mac.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: HomePod is <strong>finally</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/homepod/">available in Japan</a>.</p>

<p>The good news for the Mac doesn’t end. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/storage-upgrades-price-drop/">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple has cut the price of flash storage upgrades across its entire Mac lineup.</p>
