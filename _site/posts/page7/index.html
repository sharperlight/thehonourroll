            <h2 id="the-fate-of-hong-kong">The Fate of Hong Kong</h2>

<p>As I await to board a flight to Hong Kong, I wonder how the situation escalated so acutely in such a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Hong Kong was perhaps fated to this collision course ever since the days of empire, after it was taken by the British. After that, the British faced a situation of “damned if you, damned if you don’t” when it came to deciding Hong Kong’s sovereignty.</p>

<p>With 20/20 hindsight it’s easy to criticise the British decision to annex Hong Kong to the PRC. At the time, however, it seemed like the sensible thing to do. The PRC had adopted its “two systems one country” rule under the Deng Xiaoping, and China was an up and coming superpower. There was also hope and optimism that China would soften its stance towards its citizens, and expand their civil rights.</p>

<p>But, then again, one could’ve lashed out against the British decision citing Tiananmen Square as a prime example of China saying one thing but doing another.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, the people of Hong Kong, and the international community, must come to accept the 1997 annexation. But, China should be held responsible for overreaching and violating its “two system one country” promise. There is very little doubt that the controversial extradition bill was the spark that blew the TNT on this entire situation. That was clearly wrong, and could only come across as disingenuous.</p>

<p>Hopefully, calm heads will prevail.</p>

            <h2 id="facebook-listens-to-and-transcribes-your-messenger-calls"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio">Facebook Listens to and Transcribes your Messenger Calls</a></h2>

<p>In news that is surprising to nobody, Bloomberg reports that Facebook has been hiring external contractors to listen to and transcribe private conversations on its popular Messenger app. Facebook defends its actions by saying that companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google do the same thing. Unfortunately for Facebook and Zuckerberg, things are not that simple.</p>

<p>A recent report from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings">The Guardian</a> revealed that Apple listened to a small sample of audio recordings; but only of customers interacting with Siri. Google too was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17594802/google-home-how-to-delete-conversations-recorded">caught red handed</a> recording Google Home and “OK Google!” interactions, and at a much larger scale than what Apple did with Siri. Amazon was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/7/17092334/amazon-alexa-devices-strange-laughter">worst offender</a>, as it was revealed that its Echo speakers consistently listened to everything users said.</p>

<p>But, there is still a big difference between Facebook, and Amazon, Apple, and Google. The latter used voice recordings of customers interacting with their AI voice assistants, while Facebook actually listens to your private conversations with other people. It’s actually a pretty stark difference.</p>

<p>This is just another reason, on an ever growing list, to take digital privacy seriously.</p>
