        <h5>09 July 2019</h5>
        <p>
            <h2 id="apple-adjusts-entry-level-macbook-configurations">Apple Adjusts Entry-Level MacBook Configurations</h2>

<p>Apple has quietly adjusted its mid-2019 lineup for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro</a>:</p>

<p>The 12-inch MacBook with Retina display is no longer for sale. This shouldn’t be to a surprise to anyone. The 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro does a much better job of being an ultraportable, ultrafast device at a similar price point. Realistically speaking, the 12-inch MacBook was doomed as soon as Intel abandoned its plans to further develop competitive sub 5w and 3w mobile processors.</p>

<p>The 13-inch MacBook Air is now the entry-level MacBook, available from just US$999 (with student discount). This should’ve happened from launch day, but I suppose it’s better late than never. Its Retina display now comes with True Tone technology too.</p>

<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro with two Thunderbolt 3 ports and <strong>no</strong> Touch Bar – dubbed the MacBook Escape by Apple fans – is no longer available. Again, this should’ve happened with the launch of 2018 MacBook Air.</p>

<p>The new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and two Thunderbolt 3 ports is now available from US$1,299. This means that <strong>every</strong> MacBook Pro now comes with Touch ID and the Touch Bar. Hallelujah, we finally have some consistency across the MacBook Pro lineup!</p>

<p>A lot of these changes should’ve happened a long time ago, but perhaps were delayed or deferred until Apple could hit sufficient manufacturing yields and margins.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
Unfortunately, the entire MacBook lineup still features Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks">much maligned butterfly keyboards</a>, so we’ll have to wait a little while longer to get new keyboards. I expect this to happen either the end of this year, or early next year when Apple moves to a new chassis across its MacBook lineups.</p>

<p>But, we should focus on the positives of today’s shuffling: the MacBook lineup finally makes some damn sense. Students and people who want portable macOS should aim for the MacBook Air, working professionals take the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and content creators and developers can claim the 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Following updates to the iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro, 2019 is shaping up to be a great year for the Mac.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: HomePod is <strong>finally</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/homepod/">available in Japan</a>.</p>

<p>The good news for the Mac doesn’t end. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/storage-upgrades-price-drop/">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple has cut the price of flash storage upgrades across its entire Mac lineup.</p>

<p>Mary Hui at Quarz:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hong Kong’s protesters are using AirDrop, a file-sharing feature that allows Apple devices to send photos and videos over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, to breach China’s Great Firewall in order to spread information to mainland Chinese visitors in the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What an amazing way to avoid the Great Firewall of China, and to spread information in a peaceful way toward their cause. I continue to be impressed and moved by what’s happening in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>I continue to hope that the Hong Kong people achieve further independence, and to protect their democratic rights and freedoms.</p>
