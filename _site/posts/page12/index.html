            <h2 id="binge-thinking-podcast-episode-26-economic-booms-and-busts"><a href="https://bingethinkingpodcast.com/episodes/2018/2/27/episode-26-economic-booms-and-busts-with-david-murakami?fbclid=IwAR3KsopIrVunDbMvWkblbBTT45L7U7VFO2Q3LhICWAluPXVUeTGJvOZcqyA">Binge Thinking Podcast Episode 26: Economic Booms and Busts</a></h2>

<p>Another gem I found on my Facebook page. My friend <a href="https://bingethinkingpodcast.com/host">Caspar Roxburgh</a> hosts the Binge Thinking podcast:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Binge Thinking’ is a conversation podcast for young intellectuals, activists or just interesting people. Guests share their thoughts on who they are, what they do, and how the modern world looks from their perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The show reveals millennial insights into industries, events, or debates. Listen to smart, funny, eccentric and sometimes outrageous guests you can relate to. If you will live through the next 50 years, hear about those that will be there too. We binge news and current affairs, working life, identity politics, political politics, personal philosophies, relationships and everything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was lucky enough to be invited onto the podcast for its 26th episode back in February 2018. It was a huge blast, and hopefully I can make a return to Caspar’s show again.</p>

        <p>
            <h2 id="the-prophet-by-kahlil-gibran">“The Prophet” by Kahlil Gibran</h2>

<p>A beautiful quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.<br />
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears. And how else can it be?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The deeper the sorrow that carved into your being, the more joy you can contain. Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?  And is not the lute that soothes your spirit the very wood that was hollowed with knives?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and other say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.”<br />
But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.<br />
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.</p>
</blockquote>
