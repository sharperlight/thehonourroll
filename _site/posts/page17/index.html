            <h2 id="alabama-abortion-and-insane-law-applications"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/us/charges-dropped-alabama-woman-pregnant.html?action=click&amp;module=Top+Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;fbclid=IwAR3P6lvCmH_TCioufgEmV9Xer4EN55buLLNJ-oK1xfyg9mKwTcZRomkpKqg">Alabama, Abortion, and Insane Law Applications</a></h2>

<p>By now, you’ve probably already heard about Alabama’s controversial abortion laws, and the absolutely mind boggling case of Marshae Jones. From the New York Times article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marshae Jones, was accused of beating up a co-worker who ultimately drew a gun and fired it, wounding Ms. Jones in the stomach and killing her five-month-old fetus. A grand jury in Jefferson County, convened by District Attorney Lynneice Washington, dismissed charges against the co-worker, saying she had acted in self-defense. But it indicted Ms. Jones for “initiating a fight knowing she was five months pregnant.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under Alabama law, a fetus is considered to have the same rights as a child who has already been born. The grand jury sought to hold someone accountable for its death and Ms. Jones was arrested last week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After drawing wide spread criticism, and becoming top news in the US, prosecutors announced on Wednesday that they would be dropping the manslaughter charges <strong>against Ms Jones</strong>. The fact that the law was applied in this way, such that a grand jury decided that Ms Jones be held accountable for the loss of her unborn baby, is absolutely insane. I’m legitimately baffled at this entire case, and have to remind myself that this is taking place in the US.</p>

<p>Interesting paper from Owen Zidar (Princeton and the NBER) on the links between income tax cuts and economic activity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find that the positive relationship between tax cuts and employment growth is largely driven by tax cuts for lower-income groups and that the effect of tax cuts for the top 10 percent on employment growth is small.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a nut shell, trickle down economics is rubbish.</p>
