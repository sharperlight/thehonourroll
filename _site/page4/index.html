        <h5>26 September 2019</h5>
        <p>
            <h2 id="unequal-we-stand"><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w15483.pdf">Unequal We Stand</a></h2>

<p>I was fortunate enough to attend the 5th Oxford – Federal Reserve Bank of New York – Bank of England monetary economics conference today. The keynote speech was delivered by <a href="http://www.jonathanheathcote.com">Jonathan Heathcote</a>, who is a brilliant research economist at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have access to his presentation slides, but his research showed a very clear and simple result: inequality in the United States is worsening, and it is potentially driven by cyclicality in the business cycle. We already know that recessions disproportionately affect the poor more so than the rich. However, Heathcote’s research connects recessions and downswings in the business cycle very convincingly to worsening income inequality in the United States.</p>

<p>Simply put, according to Heathcote’s research, low skilled workers are particularly vulnerable to losing their jobs in a recession because of their substitutability, which in turn makes it more difficult for them to find employment even after a recession. As a double whammy, the economy takes a long time – a really long time – to recover from a recession and reach a stage where employment of low skilled workers recovers. The unfortunate effect of all this is that many low skilled workers enter long term unemployment, and even leave the labour force, further exacerbating the inequality problem.</p>

<p>For those interested in the topic, I suggest reading Heathcote et al. (2009) (linked above), and waiting for Heathcote to release the new paper. His previous work was based on data prior to the global financial crisis (GFC). No doubt that the GFC has made this issue more prevalent than before.</p>

<p>An insightful and somber quote from Japanese poet and novelist, Natsume Soseki (1867-1916):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You see, loneliness is the price we have to pay for being born in this modern age, so full of freedom, independence, and our own egoistical selves.</p>
