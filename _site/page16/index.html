<p>I originally saw this on John Gruber’s Daring Fireball, but I had to share it here because it’s just another classic example of Chinese-based smartphone companies blatantly ripping off and copying Apple.</p>

<p>This is the closest real-life example we can get of the homework meme.</p>

            <h2 id="japans-single-greatest-challenge"><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/07/02/national/social-issues/japans-gender-problem-human-disaster-says-award-winning-scholar-chizuko-ueno/#.XR4bMy1L3UI">Japan’s Single Greatest Challenge</a></h2>

<p>A fantastic piece from The Japan Times, providing a spotlight on Professor Chizuko Ueno and her continuing fight for gender equality in Japan.</p>

<p>Professor Ueno gave a fantastic speech to this year’s graduate intake at The University of Tokyo, reminding the students not to succumb to ivory tower syndrome, and to raise awareness on the single biggest plague and infection in Japanese society, misogyny:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are people whose drive is dampened even before they try because of negative comments or thoughts like ‘You won’t succeed no matter what’ or ‘After all, nobody believes in me,’ ” she said. “I hope you won’t focus your efforts only to win the game for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I hope you will use your gifted talents and favorable environment to help those who are less fortunate, and do not denigrate them. And I hope you live your life by accepting who you are even with your weaknesses and by helping and supporting each other,”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 70-year-old scholar, who is also a chief director of the nonprofit Women’s Action Network, pointed out that less than 20 percent of students entering the University of Tokyo, better known as Todai, are female. This is despite there being plentiful evidence that female applicants have higher standard scores than their male competitors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People often ask me what I think Japan’s greatest crisis is: China and the US, North Korea, rapidly ageing demographics, or maybe deflation and slow GDP growth? No. It’s the blatant double standards and the glass ceiling that women across Japan have to face on a constant basis. Don’t even get me started on the large social costs that this incurs – if we just focus on the economic costs, how many Nobel Prizes, breakthroughs in science and technology, and seismic productivity improvements has Japan lost by failing to ensure an equality of opportunity to the millions of highly intelligent women in this country?</p>

<p>For all of Japan’s obsessions with gaining equal footing with the West from an economic, political, and cultural point of view, it will forever be relegated as second-class so long as women here are treated here as second-class.</p>
