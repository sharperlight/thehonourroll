            <h2 id="apple-purchases-intels-modem-business"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/">Apple Purchases Intel’s Modem Business</a></h2>

<p>Add this to the list of things I thought would happen. This is another natural progression of Apple’s – and perhaps more specifically, Tim Cook’s – approach to its platforms and devices.</p>

<p>Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve worked with Intel for many years and know this team shares Apple’s passion for designing technologies that deliver the world’s best experiences for our users. Apple is excited to have so many excellent engineers join our growing cellular technologies group, and know they’ll thrive in Apple’s creative and dynamic environment. They, together with our significant acquisition of innovative IP, will help expedite our development on future products and allow Apple to further differentiate moving forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With full control over the CPU, GPU, and now, cellular modem, this will allow Apple to further increase their already dominant lead in hardware performance and efficiency on their devices.</p>

<p>There’s been a lot of talk in the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/14676/apple-to-buy-bulk-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business">tech media</a> about how this Intel deal will affect Apple’s 2020 (and beyond) iPhones – particularly iPhone’s 5G capabilities.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I think a lot of pundits are missing another key opportunity that this buyout presents Apple: the opportunity to miniaturise cellular modems for ultraportable devices and wearables.</p>

<p>While iPhone will be the short term benefactor of this deal, I think the bigger winners amongst Apple’s devices and platforms will be the Apple Watch, AirPods, and perhaps other future yet-to-be-announced wearable devices. The Mac and iPad will also benefit from Apple’s in-house modems, but to lesser extent as they’re nowhere near as thermally or physically limited as the iPhone and Apple Watch.</p>

<p>I also believe that this won’t be the last we hear of Apple’s desire to control more of the components in its devices. For example, we know that Apple is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/apple-is-said-to-develop-displays-to-replace-samsung-screens">developing MicroLED technology</a>, with potentially significant benefits across all of its hardware platforms. Phil Schiller has also talked about how important camera technology is to iPhone, and how he views iPhone as the modern-day replacement to the point-and-shoot camera. So we may see Apple make further aggressive moves in the areas of camera technology.</p>

<p>In any case, this Apple-Intel deal will be a boon to Apple – and, more importantly, to Apple’s customers.</p>

        <p>
            <h2 id="japans-secret-shame-and-the-courage-of-shiori-ito"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html">Japan’s Secret Shame and the Courage of Shiori Ito</a></h2>

<p>Last month I was invited to a public screening of the BBC produced documentary, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3z44Njyr5wzm3wbVMGZ7tFr/shiori-ito-japan-s-attitudes-to-allegations-of-sexual-violence-are-locked-in-the-past?fbclid=IwAR0_v4FXCMuaBYGNg_t5KbYoBUisaqSjWbFX7SmpyOonLtqgfEhU6x0fT54">Japan’s Secret Shame</a>. The screening was organised by <a href="https://telljp.com/?fbclid=IwAR1rAFC4EUCMwhf92pCQ2Qsp7AcwL915fXOhw6SAUXvAuLTpEQ0tE0YxL1g">tell Japan</a>, an organisation dedicated to counselling and raising awareness around mental health issues in Japan. They’re a fantastic organisation, and I recommend everyone to check them out.</p>

<p>Japan’s Secret Shame tells the story of Shiori Ito, a former journalism student who was studying in New York with ambitions to return to Japan to start her career. While in New York she met Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a senior journalist from broadcaster TBS Japan. Mr Yamaguchi made an informal promise to Ms Ito that he would help with her career once her studies were complete in New York, and after she returned back to Tokyo. Ms Ito, like any enthusiastic young person willing to make their mark on the world, took Mr Yamaguchi up on his offer.</p>

<p>Ms Ito returned to Tokyo once her studies were finished, and she met Mr Yamaguchi in person over dinner. Mr Yamaguchi had other plans for their encounter however.</p>

<p>Ms Ito alleges that Mr Yamaguchi drugged and raped her.</p>

<p>Whether or not you believe Ms Ito’s account of events is one thing — the documentary isn’t concerned about that. What the documentary highlights is Japan’s ridiculously archaic and barbaric legal system, completely inept and unable to support victims of sexual violence — whether it be women, men, or — tragically — children.</p>

<p>Further, the documentary shines a spotlight on the disgusting and idiotic views of politicians such as <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/09/05/national/lgbt-politicians-condemn-diet-members-slur-lgbt-couples-ask-abe/#.XTg4ri1L3UI">Mio Sugita</a> and other media shock jocks, who have done nothing but condemn Ms Ito and the thousands of other Japanese women each year who are brave enough to speak out against rape and sexual violence.</p>

<p>I strongly urge you all, if you have a spare hour, to watch Japan’s Secret Shame. It’s not an easy watch, but it is extremely informative and of critical importance.</p>

<p>I viewed it at a public screening, and witnessed the impact it had on the audience. As I turned to the rest of audience after the screening, I noticed that dozens of women were left with hands over their mouths and with tears in their eyes. No doubt this issue — this injustice — hit close to home for many.</p>
