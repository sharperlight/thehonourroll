&lt;p&gt;An insightful and somber quote from Japanese poet and novelist, Natsume Soseki (1867-1916):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You see, loneliness is the price we have to pay for being born in this modern age, so full of freedom, independence, and our own egoistical selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Apple usually explains complicated technologies in a simple to understand manner – arguably the best in the industry – honestly, the 10 September event was confusing, light on details, and quite underwhelming. Exciting technologies such as the U1 chip, Deep Fusion, and SoC details [for Apple Watch Series 5] barely got any mention. There was way too much time dedicated to game demos, advertising videos, and speaker transitions. Not to mention a very head-tilting naming scheme for the new lineup of iPhones. &lt;em&gt;iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/em&gt;… really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not simply name the lineup: &lt;em&gt;iPhone 11&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;iPhone 11 Pro&lt;/em&gt;, and then differentiate the two Pro iPhones by size? This would at least bring some consistency between &lt;em&gt;iPhone Pro&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/em&gt;. Heck, I’ve been hoping Apple would drop model numbers entirely and just refer to iPhones by their launch year. I think most people would agree that &lt;em&gt;iPhone Pro&lt;/em&gt; (2019, 6.5-inch) is a lot better than &lt;em&gt;iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/em&gt;. But anyway, my issues with Apple’s confusing naming scheme should be saved for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this week’s keynote, Phil Schiller took stage to explain some of the secrets behind the iPhone 11’s camera technology. Of particular note and interest was Deep Fusion. Schiller’s explanation left a lot to be desired – and a lot to the imagination. Frustratingly, a lot of tech journalists have little idea what Deep Fusion is and have struggled to explain what the technology does. For example, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/apple-iphone-deep-fusion/&quot;&gt;engadget article&lt;/a&gt; says that Deep Fusion is Apple’s technology to tackle Google’s Night Sight. This is completely false. Apple will be employing Night Mode to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding of Deep Fusion is that it is a machine learning (ML) based technology, powered by the A13 Bionic’s Neural Engine to replace or sidestep the camera’s image signalling processor (ISP) image capturing pipeline. My guess is that Deep Fusion only replaces the ISP’s duties for still photos, and that the ISP does most of the heavy lifting for other photo modes and video. When taking a photo, the A13 Bionic and iPhone’s camera lenses will basically take nine images: four short burst images taken before the user hits the photo button, four short burst images once the user hits the photo button, and a single long exposure image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The A13 Bionic’s Neural Engine will then analyse all nine images, applying various algorithms at the pixel and sub-pixel level to blend the images and combine them into a final image. The closest comparison I can think would be advanced anti-aliasing filtering techniques from the likes of AMD and Nvidia when it comes to 3D rendering pipelines. The key point is that the A13 Bionic determines how the final image is put together, pixel by pixel, rather than the camera ISP bluntly and broadly fusing multiple captured images. The technology is remarkable, and I’m just so surprised that Apple didn’t take more time to explain it further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure someone from the likes of Anandtech or Arstechnica will explore Deep Fusion soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Apple’s Deep Fusion Technology</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Arrival</title><link href="/2019/09/13/arrival.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Arrival" /><published>2019-09-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/2019/09/13/arrival</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/09/13/arrival.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;touchdown&quot;&gt;Touchdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day, another Facebook user data and privacy breach. From the techcrunch article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The exposed server contained more than 419 million records over several databases on users across geographies, including 133 million records on U.S.-based Facebook users, 18 million records of users in the U.K., and another with more than 50 million records on users in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But because the server wasn’t protected with a password, anyone could find and access the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is getting absolutely ridiculous. You would have to be insane to trust Facebook with any of your private data, let alone a hotdog stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, just to remind you all: Facebook owns Instagram and Whatsapp too. Whatever data you have on those platforms isn’t safe either.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Facebook has another Privacy Breach</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tminus10</title><link href="/2019/09/02/tminus10.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tminus10" /><published>2019-09-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/2019/09/02/tminus10</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/09/02/tminus10.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;t-minus-10&quot;&gt;T-Minus 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 days to go before I leave Japan for the UK. My gosh, time flies. Sometimes I still struggle to believe that I’ve been in Japan for this long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perth, and the suburbs of Joondalup and Clarkson, seem so far away now…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have little idea where I’ll end up after the UK. When I’m asked where I plan on being after the UK I usually answer:
“Hopefully somewhere interesting, or a place where I’m happy.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">T-Minus 10</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hongkong</title><link href="/2019/08/16/hongkong.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hongkong" /><published>2019-08-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/2019/08/16/hongkong</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/08/16/hongkong.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fate-of-hong-kong&quot;&gt;The Fate of Hong Kong&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I await to board a flight to Hong Kong, I wonder how the situation escalated so acutely in such a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong was perhaps fated to this collision course ever since the days of empire, after it was taken by the British. After that, the British faced a situation of “damned if you, damned if you don’t” when it came to deciding Hong Kong’s sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 20/20 hindsight it’s easy to criticise the British decision to annex Hong Kong to the PRC. At the time, however, it seemed like the sensible thing to do. The PRC had adopted its “two systems one country” rule under the Deng Xiaoping, and China was an up and coming superpower. There was also hope and optimism that China would soften its stance towards its citizens, and expand their civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, then again, one could’ve lashed out against the British decision citing Tiananmen Square as a prime example of China saying one thing but doing another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case may be, the people of Hong Kong, and the international community, must come to accept the 1997 annexation. But, China should be held responsible for overreaching and violating its “two system one country” promise. There is very little doubt that the controversial extradition bill was the spark that blew the TNT on this entire situation. That was clearly wrong, and could only come across as disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, calm heads will prevail.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Fate of Hong Kong</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Facebook</title><link href="/2019/08/14/facebook.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Facebook" /><published>2019-08-14T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-14T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/2019/08/14/facebook</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/08/14/facebook.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;facebook-listens-to-and-transcribes-your-messenger-calls&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio&quot;&gt;Facebook Listens to and Transcribes your Messenger Calls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In news that is surprising to nobody, Bloomberg reports that Facebook has been hiring external contractors to listen to and transcribe private conversations on its popular Messenger app. Facebook defends its actions by saying that companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google do the same thing. Unfortunately for Facebook and Zuckerberg, things are not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Apple listened to a small sample of audio recordings; but only of customers interacting with Siri. Google too was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17594802/google-home-how-to-delete-conversations-recorded&quot;&gt;caught red handed&lt;/a&gt; recording Google Home and “OK Google!” interactions, and at a much larger scale than what Apple did with Siri. Amazon was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/7/17092334/amazon-alexa-devices-strange-laughter&quot;&gt;worst offender&lt;/a&gt;, as it was revealed that its Echo speakers consistently listened to everything users said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there is still a big difference between Facebook, and Amazon, Apple, and Google. The latter used voice recordings of customers interacting with their AI voice assistants, while Facebook actually listens to your private conversations with other people. It’s actually a pretty stark difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just another reason, on an ever growing list, to take digital privacy seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Facebook Listens to and Transcribes your Messenger Calls</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Oxford</title><link href="/2019/08/07/oxford.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Oxford" /><published>2019-08-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/2019/08/07/oxford</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/08/07/oxford.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-the-next-adventure&quot;&gt;To the Next Adventure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It brings me great pleasure to belatedly announce to my dear friends and family, that I have been officially accepted as a graduate student into the University of Oxford. I will begin my studies at Oxford this September, with a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that this has been a long time coming would be an understatement. This announcement marks the achievement of a dream and goal that began over six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, and most importantly, being accepted into Oxford is not due to the efforts of me alone. I cannot stress this enough. I was well and truly supported, motivated, inspired, mentored, and challenged to get this far. The list of people who I wish to extend my most sincere thanks and appreciation is long. Chances are, if you’re reading this, you are one of the people I wish to thank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my amazing friends and family I grew up with, laughed with, worked with, and studied with in Perth, Osaka, Canberra, and Tokyo: &lt;strong&gt;Thank you!&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, I wish to express my most sincere gratitude to Professor Ippei Fujiwara. One of the most dedicated, passionate, sharpest and brightest individuals I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. I hope to continue his legacy and passion for research, teaching, and desire for knowledge. I’ve got big shoes to fill, but I approach the challenge with enthusiasm and boundless optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it is also imperative to keep in mind that this is just another step – another journey – in the adventure of life. I look forward to discovering, learning, and achieving even bigger and better things – with all your support. I am absolutely certain that there will be good times and bad times. Times where I will fall, fail, and make mistakes. I ask that you continue to tolerate, teach, and help me with whatever comes next, together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">To the Next Adventure</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hiroshima</title><link href="/2019/08/06/hiroshima.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hiroshima" /><published>2019-08-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/2019/08/06/hiroshima</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/08/06/hiroshima.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;todays-the-day&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hpmmuseum.jp/?lang=eng&quot;&gt;Today’s the Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a change of pace, rather than talking about Apple, let’s talk about Intel (oh boy…). As many who have been following PC hardware recently would know, Intel has been struggling. They’ve been stuck on their 14nm process for years, their Skylake architecture is looking very long in the tooth, their consumer lineup is a horrible mess, AMD has become a very real threat in enterprise and server markets, and x86’s future remains as uncertain as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, however, believe that Intel will make a strong turnaround next year. This will be spearheaded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/raja-m-koduri/#gs.ta1ti3&quot;&gt;Raja Koduri&lt;/a&gt; leading Intel’s GPU technology efforts, and semiconductor architect superstar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/13048/an-anandtech-exclusive-the-jim-keller-interview&quot;&gt;Jim Keller&lt;/a&gt; joining the fray too. I anticipate big and significant announcements from Koduri and Keller, who have pulled off miracle after miracle everywhere they’ve been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, more immediate than whatever projects Koduri and Keller are working on, is the upcoming introduction and launch of Intel’s new CPU microarchitecture. At long last, Skylake has a successor – one that will also come out on Intel’s perhaps still janky 10nm process. Say hello to Sunny Cove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hirothreading.github.io/thehonourroll//assets/images/intelsunnycove.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intel's Sunny Cove microarchitecture&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anandtech has prepared a fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/14514/examining-intels-ice-lake-microarchitecture-and-sunny-cove&quot;&gt;deep dive&lt;/a&gt; on Sunny Cove. If you have a free afternoon, I definitely recommend taking a good read. According to this Anandtech report, Intel has rejigged their CPU architecture in dramatic fashion – perhaps as big of a change since the Nehalem to Sandy Bridge transition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Intel can deliver on all their promises, then we’re looking at some significant performance, power efficiency, and platform/package efficiency gains. Average instruction per-clock gains are predicted to be roughly 18% over Skylake, on-die integration of Thunderbolt 3 (and hence a doubling of PCIe lanes from the CPU die), a revamped cache and memory controller system, and a large increase in GPU resources all point toward a very impressive new architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, if Intel can deliver on these promises…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Intel’s New 𝛍arch</summary></entry></feed>
